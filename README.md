# Tropical-Forest-Ecology
Investigate soil moisture, soil temperature, and soil oxygen data across topographic gradient collected from sensors in a wet tropical rainforest in Puerto Rico. Currently focusing on finding a model that best fit change in the soil variables due to hurricane Irma and Maria to better predict the effect future changes in climate on soil variables.
